# Ford Go-Bike System Data Exploration
## by Sony Okpara


## Dataset

This data includes information about 174,760 individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. Features of the data include age, user type, trip duration, among other trip attributes. The dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://video.udacity-data.com/topher/2020/October/5f91cf38_201902-fordgobike-tripdata/201902-fordgobike-tripdata.csv&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1658556134051083&usg=AOvVaw14b1G3lSqe0xCQM6x9DQTH).


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that the duration of a trip was largely dependent on the age and type of users, with modifying effect from weekday, hour of day on which the trip was made and gender. I found that users of ages 40 and below tend to spend longer trip duration than older users and the average age of subscribers was higher than that of customers. Consequently, customers who are moslty younger than subscribers, do longer trip durations.

Outside the main features of interest, I discovered that subscribers tend to make shorter trips on each weekday, which it is completely the reverse for customers. Subscribers make most trips between 7am and 9am with a peak at 8am. In the evening, usage by subscribers is mostly between 4pm and 6pm with a peak at 5pm. In terms of gender, males are the most users followed by females. Interestingly, female customers spend more trip duration than males. 



## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, my focus will be on the influence of age, duration, weekday and user type and leave out most of the intermediate derivations. I start by intoducing the age varable, next I plot the user type distribution, and followed by a plot of the weekday distribution. 

Afterwards, I introduce the distribution of age, duration and user type to see the pattern of relationship between them using a scatter plot, as I feel it makes the pattern clearer. 

Finally, I round up by introducing the distribution of duration, weekday and user type. Here, I use the clustered bar chart for easier pattern observation.
